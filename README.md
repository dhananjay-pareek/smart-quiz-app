> 🎯 A quiz app that keeps asking until you learn it all.  
> Wrong answers come back later — so you **can’t escape learning** 😅

## ✨ Features
- ✅ Multiple Choice & True/False Questions

## 🚀 How It Works
1. The app shows a question.  
2. If your answer is **correct**, it marks the question as learned.  
3. If your answer is **wrong**, the question goes back into the queue.  
4. Game continues until **all questions are mastered** 🎉  

It’s like your personal **smart teacher + revision tool** 👨‍🏫✨
